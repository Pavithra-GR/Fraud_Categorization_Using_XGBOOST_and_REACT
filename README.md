# Cyberthon - Cyber Crime Case Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

Cyberthon is an AI-driven cybercrime classification system designed to assist law enforcement and citizens in identifying and categorizing cybercrime cases effectively. The model classifies cases based on user input and provides guided assistance for filing reports on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP).

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Cybercrime Case Classification**: Utilizes XGBoost to accurately categorize different types of cybercrimes.
- **Local Language Support**: Enables users to interact in their native language for better accessibility.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts classified case details into speech for an enhanced user experience.
- **Data Security**: Ensures user data privacy and secure transmission.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides transparency in classification decisions.
- **Feedback-Based Training**: Enhances model performance through continuous learning from user feedback.

## 🎯 Model Performance

- **Category Accuracy Prediction**: 82.83% (82.83350237548711)
- **Sub-Category Accuracy Prediction**: 69.60% (69.60017082154487)
